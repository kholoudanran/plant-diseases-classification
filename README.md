# plant-diseases-classification

## Overview
A deep learning model that classifies 15 types of plant diseases using convolutional neural networks (CNN). Achieves **91.16% accuracy** in identifying diseases across pepper, potato, and tomato plants.

## Classes Recognized
The model classifies the following 15 conditions:

| Category | Disease |
|----------|---------|
| Pepper | Bacterial spot, Healthy |
| Potato | Healthy, Early blight, Late blight |
| Tomato | Healthy, Bacterial spot, Early blight, Late blight, Leaf Mold, Septoria leaf spot, Spider mites, Target Spot, Tomato mosaic virus, Yellow Leaf Curl Virus |

Dataset
The model was trained on the PlantVillage dataset containing:

54,305 images

15 disease classes

3 plant species (Pepper, Potato, Tomato)
